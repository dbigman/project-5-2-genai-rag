1. Project Setup and Planning
Define Objectives & Scope
Clarify the main goal of your RAG system (e.g., Q&A, semantic search, content generation).
Decide on the domain (e.g., news, scientific papers, product reviews) based on the datasets available.
Set Deliverables
Python code with clear documentation.
Detailed project report covering methodology, EDA findings, system architecture, evaluation, and conclusions.
A short presentation with visuals (charts, sample responses, etc.).
Bonus: Interactive demo (web interface/API).
Establish Timeline & Milestones
Create a timeline (e.g., a 10â€“12 week plan) with milestones for dataset selection, EDA, development, evaluation, and final delivery.
2. Dataset Selection
Review Available Datasets
Common Crawl (news and web data)
Paperswithcode Text Datasets
Biology scientific papers
Puerto Rico news articles
Financial Laws Collection
Selection Criteria
Relevance: Does the dataset align with your intended application (e.g., Q&A, content summarization)?
Quality & Size: Is the data clean and substantial enough for retrieval tasks?
Multimodal Bonus: Consider datasets that include additional modalities (text + images/audio) if you wish to expand the scope.
Decision & Acquisition
Choose one (or a combination) of the datasets.
Download and store the dataset(s) locally or on cloud storage for analysis.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Initial Inspection
Examine data structure, formats, and metadata.
Identify any missing values, duplicates, or inconsistencies.
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Clean the data as necessary (e.g., removing noise, normalizing text).
If required, split long documents into smaller, coherent chunks.
Visualization & Reporting
Use visualization libraries (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn) to generate charts showing data distributions, word frequencies, etc.
Document insights and challenges that might affect the retrieval and generation stages.
4. Embedding and Storing Chunks
4.A Generate Document Embeddings
Tool Selection
Use all-MiniLM-L6-v2 for English text.
Bonus: Experiment with OpenAI embeddings if budget allows.
Processing Steps
Tokenize and chunk your documents.
Generate embeddings for each chunk using Sentence Transformers.
Validate that the embeddings capture semantic meaning by checking a few sample outputs.
4.B Connect to a Vector Database
Choosing the VectorDB
Use ChromaDB for storing and retrieving embeddings.
Bonus: Consider cloud-based options like Azure AI Search or Weaviate.
Integration Steps
Pre-process: Ensure each document chunk has an associated embedding.
Store: Upload the embeddings along with metadata (e.g., document IDs, original text) to ChromaDB.
Retrieve: Develop logic to perform similarity searches (e.g., cosine similarity) on stored embeddings given a query.
4.C Integration Frameworks
Optional Libraries
Leverage frameworks like LangChain or LlamaIndex for easier integration.
5. Connecting to a Large Language Model (LLM)
LLM Selection & Setup
Use the OpenAI API for generating responses.
Alternatively, set up a different LLM API if preferred.
Integration Workflow
Query Processing: When a user submits a query, first use the vector DB to retrieve the most relevant document chunks.
Prompt Construction: Combine the retrieved documents with the query to create a context-rich prompt.
Response Generation: Pass the prompt to the LLM and retrieve the generated answer.
Testing: Iterate on the prompt structure and retrieval parameters to fine-tune the quality of responses.
6. Evaluation
Performance Testing
Manual Evaluation: Test the system with multiple queries to understand its strengths and weaknesses.
Automated Evaluation:
Create a test set with queries and expected responses.
Bonus: Use an LLM as a judge to generate questions and evaluate the quality of the responses.
Metrics & Documentation
Define success metrics (e.g., relevance, accuracy, response time).
Document your evaluation process and results in the project report.
Identify areas for improvement and possible refinements to the pipeline.
7. Deployment (Bonus)
Web Application / API Development
Backend: Develop a RESTful API using Flask or FastAPI to handle requests and interact with your RAG system.
Frontend: Optionally, create a simple user interface using Streamlit for interactive demos.
Hosting
Deploy the application on a cloud platform such as AWS, GCP, or Heroku.
Ensure proper handling of API keys and secure data transmission.
Demo Preparation
Prepare an interactive demo to showcase during the project presentation.
8. Documentation and Presentation
Python Code Documentation
Ensure the code is modular, well-commented, and follows best practices.
Include a README with setup instructions and usage examples.
Project Report
Outline the project workflow from dataset selection to evaluation.
Include details of the EDA, system architecture, challenges, and performance metrics.
Presentation
Develop slides that cover:
Introduction and project objectives.
Key steps and methodologies.
Visualizations from the EDA.
Examples of retrieval and generated responses.
Evaluation results and conclusions.
Bonus: Incorporate a live demo if possible.
